I want to make a project with ascii and physics!

Some of my inspirations is http://patorjk.com/

I like to make some Personal Sites, and now I want to put on github to leave the open source for everyone who wants! Some open source projects have helped me a lot to learn! And that's why I want to share the code and help people with it!
